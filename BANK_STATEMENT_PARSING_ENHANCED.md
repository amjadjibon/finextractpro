# Enhanced Bank Statement Transaction Parsing

## ✅ **Parser Enhancements Made**

### **1. Enhanced Table Detection**
- **Added explicit bank statement patterns recognition**
- **Enhanced transaction pattern detection**:
  - "Card payment - [merchant]"  
  - "Direct debit - [company]"
  - "Cash withdrawal - [location]"
  - "[Company] BiWeekly Payment"
  - "Direct Deposit - [source]"

### **2. Improved Column Mapping**
- **Date Column**: Handles various formats (1 February, Feb 1, 01/02, etc.)
- **Description Column**: Full transaction details and merchant names
- **Money Out/Debit**: Withdrawal amounts, payments, fees
- **Money In/Credit**: Deposits, income, refunds
- **Balance Column**: Running balance after each transaction

### **3. Mandatory Transaction Extraction**
- **Made Transaction List REQUIRED** for bank statement parsing
- **Added comprehensive examples** in parsing prompts
- **Enhanced confidence scoring** for transaction data
- **Mathematical validation** of balances and totals

## **Sample Bank Statement Data**

```

Balance at 1 February: £40,000.00
Total money in: £5,474.00
Total money out: £1,395.17
Balance at 1 March: £44,079.83

```

## **Expected Parser Output**

The enhanced parser should now extract:

```json
{
  "structured_data": {
    "document_title": "Bank Statement Example",
    "primary_date": "2024-02-01",
    "secondary_date": "2024-03-01", 
    "primary_amount": "£44,079.83",
    "secondary_amount": "£40,000.00",
    "tables": [
      {
        "name": "Transaction History",
        "headers": ["Date", "Description", "Money Out", "Money In", "Balance"],
        "rows": [
          {
            "values": ["Balance brought forward", "", "", "", "40,000.00"],
            "confidence": 95
          },
          {
            "values": ["1 February", "Card payment - High St Petrol Station", "24.50", "", "39,975.50"],
            "confidence": 95
          },
          {
            "values": ["3 February", "Direct debit - Green Mobile Phone Bill", "20.00", "", "39,955.50"],
            "confidence": 95
          },
          {
            "values": ["4 February", "YourJob BiWeekly Payment", "", "2,575.00", "42,530.50"],
            "confidence": 95
          }
        ],
        "summary": {
          "total_rows": 13,
          "total_amount": "£4,079.83",
          "date_range": {
            "start": "2024-02-01",
            "end": "2024-03-01"
          }
        }
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

## **Key Improvements**

### **✅ Pattern Recognition**
- Enhanced detection of common banking transaction patterns
- Better handling of various date formats
- Improved merchant name extraction

### **✅ Structured Table Output** 
- Each transaction as a separate row with proper column mapping
- Headers array matches values array order
- Confidence scoring per transaction row

### **✅ Data Validation**
- Mathematical validation of running balances
- Cross-verification of totals
- Date chronology validation

### **✅ Mandatory Extraction**
- Transaction List marked as REQUIRED field
- Critical instructions emphasizing table extraction
- Comprehensive examples provided to AI

## **Testing the Enhanced Parser**

### **Using the Test API**
```bash
# Test with your bank statement
curl -X POST /api/ai/test \
  -F "file=@test_bank_statement.txt" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer <token>"
```

### **Expected Results**
- ✅ Document type detected as "bank-statement"
- ✅ All transactions extracted in tables array
- ✅ Proper column mapping with Date, Description, Money Out, Money In, Balance
- ✅ Summary statistics calculated
- ✅ High confidence scores (85-95%) for clear transaction data

The enhanced parser should now reliably extract complete transaction lists from bank statements, providing structured data suitable for analysis, reporting, and export functionality.
