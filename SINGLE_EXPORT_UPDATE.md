# Single Document Export Update

## ✅ **Changes Made**

### **Updated Single Document Export API**
- **File**: `/src/app/api/documents/[id]/export/route.ts`
- **Change**: Modified POST endpoint to save export details to database instead of returning direct download

### **Key Changes**

1. **Database Storage**
   - Export details are now properly saved to the `exports` table
   - Export job record includes all metadata (name, description, format, file_path, etc.)
   - Proper error handling for database insertion failures

2. **Response Structure**
   - Returns export job details instead of direct file download
   - Includes export ID, status, format, file size, and creation timestamps
   - User-friendly message directing to Exports page for download

3. **Export Workflow**
   ```
   1. User clicks "Export" on document → API creates export job
   2. AI generates export file and saves to S3 storage
   3. Export record saved to database with file path
   4. User sees success message with export details
   5. User can download from /dashboard/exports page
   ```

### **API Response Example**

**Before (direct download):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "file_url": "https://...",
  "download_url": "https://...",
  "message": "Document exported successfully"
}
```

**After (database record):**
```json
{
  "success": true,
  "export": {
    "id": "uuid",
    "name": "document_export_123",
    "description": "JSON export of document.pdf",
    "status": "completed", 
    "type": "document_export",
    "format": "json",
    "file_size": 1024,
    "records_count": 1,
    "created_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:00Z",
    "completed_at": "2024-01-15T10:30:05Z"
  },
  "message": "Document \"document.pdf\" exported successfully as JSON. You can download it from the Exports page."
}
```

### **Infrastructure Already Available**

✅ **Exports Table**: Complete database schema with status tracking, file paths, download counts
✅ **Exports API**: Full CRUD operations at `/api/exports`
✅ **Download API**: Secure download at `/api/exports/[id]/download` 
✅ **Exports Page**: UI at `/dashboard/exports` for viewing and downloading exports
✅ **S3 Storage**: Files saved to exports bucket with proper access controls

### **Benefits**

1. **Better User Experience**: Users can track export history and re-download files
2. **Proper Audit Trail**: All exports are logged with timestamps and metadata
3. **File Management**: Automatic expiration and cleanup of old exports
4. **Error Recovery**: Failed exports are tracked and can be retried
5. **Download Analytics**: Track download counts and usage patterns

### **Usage Flow**

1. **Export Document**: `POST /api/documents/{id}/export` → Creates export job
2. **View Exports**: `GET /api/exports` → Lists all user exports  
3. **Download Export**: `GET /api/exports/{id}/download` → Downloads file
4. **Track Status**: Export status shows processing → completed/failed

The single document export now properly integrates with the existing exports infrastructure, providing a complete export management system.
